A Fibonacci heap is a specific implementation of the heap data structure that makes use of Fibonacci numbers. Fibonacci heaps are used to implement the priority queue element in Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, giving the algorithm a very efficient running time.


This repository demonstrates a working example of fibonacci heap. 
In order to get your hands on, simply import those files into your project and call a `FibonacciHeap` instance.
